# Program to determine exam eligibility based on attendance percentage

# Step 1: Taking attendance input for three students
# The user enters attendance percentages as integers
a = int(input("Enter attendance % of student A: "))  # Attendance of student A
b = int(input("Enter attendance % of student B: "))  # Attendance of student B
c = int(input("Enter attendance % of student C: "))  # Attendance of student C

# Step 2: Checking eligibility for student A
# If attendance is 75% or more, the student is eligible
if a >= 75:
    print("A is eligible to write the exam!")
else:
    print("A is not eligible to write the exam!")

# Step 3: Checking eligibility for student B
if b >= 75:
    print("B is eligible to write the exam!")
else:
    print("B is not eligible to write the exam!")

# Step 4: Checking eligibility for student C
if c >= 75:
    print("C is eligible to write the exam!")
else:
    print("C is not eligible to write the exam!")
