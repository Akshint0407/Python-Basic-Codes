# Program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

# Step 1: Initialize the variable i with 1
i = 1

# Step 2: Start a while loop that runs as long as i is less than or equal to 10
while (i <= 10):  
    # Step 3: Print the current value of i
    print(i)
    
    # Step 4: Increment the value of i by 1 after each iteration
    i = i + 1
